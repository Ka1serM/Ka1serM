## About Me

<p>Hello, I'm Marcel, a computer science and media student at HSD DÃ¼sseldorf with a strong passion for 3D art and computer graphics.
Iâ€™ve been using 3D software since I was a little kid, starting with Cinema4D, and over time Iâ€™ve transitioned to using tools like Blender and Unreal Engine.
As a 3D generalist, I use whatever tools fit the task best â€” whether itâ€™s Marvelous Designer for cloth simulations, DaVinci Resolve for color grading, or After Effects for compositing.
</p> <p>My interest in programming originally grew out of a need to create custom tools for my 3D projects. That led me to explore software development more seriously and learn how to connect art with code.
</p> 
<p>Right now, I'm building on that foundation through university courses and personal projects.
Iâ€™m particularly interested in rendering â€” both real-time and offline â€” and have been experimenting with ray tracing techniques.
One of my main projects, UniversalUmap, is a desktop app for exporting 3D models, complete with an integrated 3D preview.
Itâ€™s taught me a lot about the rendering pipeline and the technical side of graphics development.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m always looking to learn more and keep growing, both as an artist and as a developer.</p>
